# Overview of the Project
> The kickstarter is a platform where projects get the money thru crowdunding. The agenda of the data sheet is to derive deep into the theater project, especially plays from the given dataset.
# Analysis and Challenges
> The dataset was not polished. It was filled with informations but it did not carry even whether a project has met its required fund or not. A lot of filters needed to be in place to start with. Then to go ahead and find the goals of each proudct to what can be pushed further in order to achieve more 'successful' projects.
# Results
> It was indeed a tough task to refind from such a huge data. But once I filtered and applied the formula to get the pivot running, it became easy.
